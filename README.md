# MachineLearningLegoSorting
Source code for my propedeuse project first year of Applied Sciences University (2017)

Very basic POC for Lego bricks recognition (Lego sorting machine). 

Decision tree learning is used for recognition and it uses Hue and Edge Histogram extractors as main inputs.

All files starting with 'test' are not used in the final program, but show how the program has grown.
